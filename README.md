# React Interview

## Task

Using the provided server, build a React application to:

1. Query a list of users
2. Show a list of users by first and last name
3. Fetch email, phone, and zip for a specific user (when necessary)
4. Display email, phone, and zip about a specific user upon request (ex: click item in list to show details) 
5. Cache information to avoid re-fetching details
6. Style the page to fit in with the styling of the reference image provided

## Requirements / Details

1. Build the application using react
2. Document any external resources used (no need to document packages. package.json is clear enough)
3. Do not use bootstrap or any like html & css system. Design and build your own
4. Do not worry about CORS. You can assume the site will run in a system with working CORS, or with CORS disabled

## Server Details

Please do not modify the sever. The source is provided for ease of use, but assume that the information returned from each endpoint is fixed.

Run the server with `node server.js`
